# A beginners guide to Bayesian cognitive modelling

This repository contains code to accompany a talk I was invited to give in 2021 at the University of Leicester, UK.

We have some [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks full of Julia code. These were run with Julia version 1.5.3
- Example 1 - [Bayesian linear regression](bayesian_linear_regression.ipynb)
- Example 2 - [Hyperbolic discounting](hyperbolic_discounting.ipynb)
- Example 3 - [Covert attention](covert_attention.ipynb)

## Julia environment

This is quite possibly optional... To avoid any version clashes with other Julia packages, you can use the environment contained here. 
- Make sure your working directory is set to the location to where you saved this repository locally. 
- In a Julia session, simply type `]` to enter package mode.
- Type `activate .` to activate the environment
